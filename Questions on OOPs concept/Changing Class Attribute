# Create a class with a class attribute a; create an object from it and set ‘a’ directly using ‘object.a = 0’. Does this change the class attribute?


class Aclass:
    a = "Greatness"

new = Aclass()
print(new.a) # Prints the class attribute because instance attribute is not present
new.a = "Shreyans" # Instance attribute is set
print(new.a) # Prints the instance attribute because instance attribute is present
print(Aclass.a) # This prints the class attribute
